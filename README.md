# TradMod Audit Portfolio
I’m an independent security researcher with a focus on smart contracts security, specializing in logic-heavy protocols, cross-chain systems, bridges, staking and restaking mechanisms, governance/DAO protocols, DEXes, etc. I’ve reported 25+ high and medium severity vulnerabilities across Solidity, Golang, and Rust-variant Cairo audit contests, and uncovered bugs in live protocols via Immunefi. My experience spans both solo and team audits, underpinned by a strong foundation in smart contracts development. Prior to focusing on security, I led a development team to victory in two major hackathons, Chainlink and ETHGlobal. 

> I am available for private smart contract security audits, testing, and collaborative team audits.
